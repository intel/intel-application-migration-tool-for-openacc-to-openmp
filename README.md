## What is Intel Application Migration Tool for OpenACC to OpenMP API?

The Intel Application Migration Tool for OpenACC to OpenMP API is a Python3-based tool that helps developers to migrate OpenACC applications into OpenMP by the means of the offloading mechanisms. The tool takes application sources (either C/C++ or Fortran languages) with OpenACC constructs and generates a semantically-equivalent source using OpenMP. Since the tool is under active development, it does not rely on compiler-infrastructures and the existing divergences between OpenACC and OpenMP specifications, the translation may need some tweaking. So, **the user takes the responsability of supervising the generated code**.

The tool does not aim at guaranteeing the best achievable performance but at generating a semantically equivalent translation. The tool tries to generate the most efficient translation but there are a number of performance tweaks (_e.g._ hardware binding (gangs, workers, vector length)) that are unlikely to be performant-portable among other hardware. This is why, once the application has been successfully ported, we encourage developers and users to use performance tools for tuning their application performance.

## Status

The tool recognizes many  of the OpenACC compute and data constructs but cannot translate OpenACC API calls at the moment. The tool generates a source file with the original contents plus the OpenMP translated constructs. These constructs can be wrapped using `#ifdef` and `#endif` pre-processing directives.

Given the semantic differences between some OpenACC constructs and their closest OpenMP constructs, there are a few caveats that users should be aware:

*  The _kernels_ construct is a prescriptive construct for the OpenACC compiler to automatically extract the parallelism from the code enclosed by the construct and it has no direct OpenMP counter-part. The tool, by default, converts this construct into a serial offloaded region because it cannot identify potential parallelism. However, the tool also provides a few experimental knobs to take advantage of loops within kernels annotated with the _loop_ construct.
*  The _present_ data-mapping clause does exist in recent OpenMP specifications, however there are compilers that do not support it yet. The tool provides a few alternatives that would mimic this clause but at the expense of performance.
*  Similarly as above, the _loop_ construct appeared in recent OpenMP specifications. The tool suggests using this construct over using other alternatives (e.g. _for_ and _do_).
*  The asynchronous mechanisms in OpenACC and OpenMP differ. For the time being, the tool has a very naive support to migrate the _async_ and _wait_ constructs that may map correctly on applications that use them in a simple manner.
*  The _routine_ construct is currently only implemented in Fortran and implementation for C/C++ is WIP.
*  The hardware binding clauses (_gangs, workers, vector length_) are ignored by default. However, the tool user can migrate these clauses into the OpenMP translation to evaluate the performance impact.

In addition to these, the tool generates a report for each migrated file with information about the suggested translation and potential issues/warnings related to either the original or the suggested codes.

## Using the tool

To invoke the translator, use the following command: 

       <path>/src/intel-application-migration-tool-for-openacc-to-openmp <optional-flags> <input-files>

where `<input-files>` refers to source-code files containing OpenACC constructs. For each given input-file, the tool will generate a translation file named `<input-file>.translated` and will also dump a report with translation details into a file named `<input-file>.report`.

The tool supports the following optional flags:

* `-[no-]force-backup` (default: **disabled**)
Enforces the translator to write a backup file with .original extension of the processed file even if a backed up file exists. If disabled, the tool will refuse to proceed with the translation.
* `-[no-]generate-report` (default: **enabled**)
Generates a translation report into a separate file with the .report extension.
* `-[no-]generate-multidimensional-alternate-code` (default: **enabled**)
Provides implementation suggestions for _acc enter_/_acc exit_ constructs to be employed if the multi-dimensional data is non-contiguous (only in C).
* `-keep-binding-clauses=[none,all,gang,worker,vector]` (defaut: **none**)
Specifies which OpenACC hardware binding clauses (none, all, or a comma-separated combination of:_gang_, _worker_ or _vector_) are kept in the translation.
* `-[no-]overwrite-input` (default: **disabled**)
When enabled, the translator will overwrite the input file with the translation file.
* `-present=<alloc,tofrom,keep>` (default: **alloc**)
Specifies how the tool translates OpenACC's present clause:
    * `alloc` -- into OpenMP's _map(alloc)_.
    * `tofrom` -- into OpenMP's _map(tofrom)_. Note that this is may be less performant.
    * `keep` -- keep using the present clause but using the OpenMP approach -- but note that this requires OpenMP 5.0+ compatible compiler.
* `-async=<ignore,nowait>` (default: **nowait**)
Selects how the async OpenACC clauses are translated.
   * `ignore` -- do ignore the _async_ and _wait_ clauses -- note that this might have a performance impact.
   * `nowait` -- convert into _nowait_ and _taskwait_ clauses but this is not semantically equivalent to OpenACC.
* `-[no-]supress-openacc` (default: **disabled**)
The translator removes the OpenACC constructs in the translated file.
* `-[no-]-translated-openmp-conditional-define` (default: **disabled**)
The tool wraps the translated OpenMP code with `#if defined(OPENACC2OPENMP_TRANSLATED_OPENMP)` pre-processing macros.
* `-translated-openmp-conditional-define=X`
The tool wraps the translated OpenMP code with `#if defined(X)` pre-processing macros.
* `-[no-]-original-openmp-conditional-define` (default: **disabled**)
The tool wraps the original OpenMP code with `#if defined(OPENACC2OPENMP_ORIGINAL_OPENMP)` pre-processing macros.
* `-original-openmp-conditional-define=X`
The tool wraps the original code with `#if defined(X)` pre-processing macros.

## Experimental features

The tool supports some experimental features which are under development.

* `-[no-]experimental-kernels-support` (default: **enabled**)
On Fortran codes, the tool breaks the _loop_ constructs nested within _kernels_ into independent code regions to be executed back-to-back.
**NOTE**: Resulting code may not OpenMP compliant -- depending on the _kernels_ and _loop_ locations. In some circumstances, you may need to manually change the code.
**PERFORMANCE NOTE**: This feature might inject OpenMP constructs that lead to empty-kernel executions. We encourage you to visit the code and manually remove the existing empty-kernels, if any.
* `-[no-]experimental-remove-kernels-bubbles` (default: **enabled**)
This option attempts to remove empty OpenMP _target_ and _end target_ constructs injected through the use of `-experimental-kernels-support`.

## Known issues

These are the currently known issues:

* The _kernels_ construct is supported but there will appear issues when there exist control flow instructions between the _kernels_ and subsequent _loop_ constructs. Such as:
```
!$acc kernels
if (X) then
  !$acc loop
  do i = ..
  end do
end if
```
A potential workaround is to move the _kernels_ construct immediately before the _loop_ construct.

* The code parser is not able to process OpenACC constructs intertwined with preprocessor commands, such as:
```
!$acc parallel &
#if defined(X)
!$acc loop 
#else
!$acc loop vector
#endif
```
A potential solution for this is to move the preprocessor commands outside the OpenACC constructs, like:
```
#if defined(X)
!$acc parallel loop
#else
!$acc parallel loop vector
#endif
```

* The _auto_ clause from the _loop_ construct is currently ignored and the _loop_ construct is converted into a parallel loop. This may break the semantics of the migration because this tool does not search for dependencies.
